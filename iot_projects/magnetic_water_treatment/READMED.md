# Magnetic Water Treatment System

This project explores a **magnetic water treatment system** designed to reduce limescale buildup in household water. The system uses an **ESP32 microcontroller** to generate a **PWM-controlled electromagnetic field**, influencing the crystallization process of calcium carbonate to favor **aragonite formation over calcite**, thereby reducing scale deposits.
