7-Segment Display PCB

This project is a compact 4-digit 7-segment display module designed for numeric displays. It allows users to interface with external circuits or microcontrollers to display numbers dynamically, making it suitable for applications like clocks, counters, and timers.

The design includes four common cathode 7-segment displays, controlled by transistors for digit multiplexing. Current-limiting resistors are used to ensure consistent brightness and reliability. The PCB is designed for easy integration with headers for input connections and features a clean, compact layout optimized for prototyping.
